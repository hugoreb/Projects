Welcome
Here is my own made ( it is visible ) "secure chatroom" built in C programming language.
For now, you can :
-Create a chatroom
-Join a chatroom
-Send a message visible only for the chatroom where you are
-Invite someone with the commande !invite <username> (if he is not invited he can still join the room entering the name,
  but the room won't be in the list of the rooms that he can join if he chooses to list the rooms)
